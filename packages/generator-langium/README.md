## How to generate your extension

#### Open the langium project
```bash
pwd
```
   - `./langium`

#### Generate your extension
```bash
cd packages/generator-langium
npm run build
yo langium      # follow the guide
```
   - Suppose your extension has a name "my-super-language". It "respawns" in `./langium/packages/my-super-language`

#### Open the extension folder in a new window

#### Press F5
   - A new VSCode window is opened with your built-in extension
